# Time tracking software

## Desktop time tracking

Desktop time tracking is a way to track your time and organize your work and breaks on your computer. It reminds you of taking breaks, and lets you adjust sessions of work. Some even let you look at what kind of programs you use, so that you can see where you can save up time. Here are a few programs you can use.

* [Kimai](www.kimai.org)
* [Anuko](https://github.com/anuko/timetracker)
* Pomodoro timers ([Example implementation for GNOME](http://gnomepomodoro.org/))

## Web-based time tracking

Web-based time tracking is a way to track how much time you spend on each website, allowing you to see how much each takes up of your time. Ideally you'd want wikipedia, google and github to be on the top, taking up a majority of your browsing time with research. If the top results are unrelated to your research, you might want to consider cutting back on those, to improve your research efficiency.
